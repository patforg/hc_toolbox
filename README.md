# hc_toolbox
toolbox to work with hamiltonian cycles

## Building
Simply run `make` to build all utilities

## Utilities

Run any of the programs without any arguments to get more detailed usage instructions.

**hc_check**: Checks that a provided tour is a Hamiltonian Cycle for a provided graph (HCP edge list)

**hc_to_dot**: Converts a Graph in HCP edge list format to a dot format to use with Graphviz

**hc_to_concorde**: Converts a Graph in HCP edge list format to a weighted adjacency matrix to use with Concorde

**hc_solve**: Use one of the provided solvers to find a Hamiltonian cycle in provided graph (HCP edge list)
